I started writing a [Terraform provider for Sumologic][0] a while ago, but parked it because we were not at the point of implementing in our environments. 

I also sort of forgot about it, until it turned out that people were actually trying to use it, and were sending issues and pull-requests to the repository. So I decided to pick it up again, and polish it a little bit. I'm also implementing it in my own automation now, so I will be one of the first to try new functionality when I add it.

Currently, the released version is [v0.2.2][1]. Documentation is available [here][2].
